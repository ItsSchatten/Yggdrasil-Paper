## AnvilGUI

A rough replica of [WesJD's AnvilGUI](https://github.com/WesJD/AnvilGUI).

### "Changes"

1. Moved most of the API into their own classes.
    * To me, this feels more fluid and approachable for future expansions.
2. Made to work **exclusively** on Mojang mapped Paper servers.
    * This is due to how Yggdrasil itself works, it is built to run exclusively on Paper servers.
3. Additional functionality to tie into Yggdrasil-menus.
