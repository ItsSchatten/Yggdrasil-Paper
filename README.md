## Yggdrasil

Named after the sacred tree in Norse myth (and incidentally also after a Mojang Utility, whoops...), Yggdrasil contains
plenty of useful (or at least I think so) utilities in an attempt to make developing Spigot plugins for PrisonTech
easier.

When using Yggdrasil, we include a JavaDoc and sources jar in our repository; you will likely receive an error while
looking at the documentation in your IDE that bytecode does not match, this is because we use Lombok to generate some
methods automagically for us.

### How to Use
